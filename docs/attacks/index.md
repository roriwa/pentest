## Password-lists

You can find many password lists in `/usr/share/wordlists` under kali-linux.

### rockyou

The `rockyou` password-list is per default available on kali-linux under `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz`.
It's compressed because it contains thousands of passwords and has an uncompressed size of way over 100MB.
Run `gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz` once to make the normal/text version available.
